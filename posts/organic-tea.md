## Do you love Tea?

_I love tea._ Tea is perfect for any occasion! Sometimes I love a nice herbal tea to unwind at the end of the night, other times I need a slight pick me up and that’s when I reach for green. Sometimes I need a BIG pick me up and that’s when Yerba Mate or black tea is the key!

Side note: Yerba Mate probably is the closest you can get to coffee without drinking actual coffee. It’s something enjoyed all over Latin America but gaining steam in the United States as well.

While it may be tempting to reach for the two dollar box with thirty packets at the store, its important to understand that tea, like our vegetables, are treated with pesticides. And if you drink tea as much as we do (a lot!), its better to go organic. There are tons of organic tea brands out there, but in my opinion…

## Numi is the king.

Here’s a few reasons why:

### Reason One

All of their tea’s are certified organic. Not only is it organic but the company is committed to sourcing only the highest quality organic teas. They have relationships with organic farms they have worked with for many years who are subject to random testing.

2 All Numi tea is fair trade or fair labor certified. This means the farms they buy from are certified to provide fair wages and safe working conditions. Numi has contributed more than $1 million in Fair Trade Premiums which benefit the farming community.

3 – Their tea bags are made from manila hemp cellulose (plant fiber), which means they are compostable! The tag is made from recycled materials with soy based inks and the string is 100% cotton.

4 – Their wrappers are made from sustainably grown FSC® certified paper. They will completely disintegrate and do not cause eco-toxicity when they break down.

If the above wasn’t enough reason to love them, the teas are also superb! Each year my parents get me samplers so I can try new ones. Last year a massive box of random teas showed up just before Christmas. I also bought in bulk from them the year before that.
