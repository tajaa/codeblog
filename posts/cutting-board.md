## Is it made from plastic? Toxic.

When cutting on this your knife is releasing plastic particles into your food. BPA and phthalates. They typically contain antibacterial chemicals since plastic does not have a natural antibacterial property. Or they have added chemicals to lessen odors and reduce stains.

_Is it made from Bamboo? - Toxic._ Bamboo cutting boards must be glued together. They usually use a mineral oil finish which is a by-product of petroleum.

Is it made from stainless steel? - Toxic. Nickel and heavy metal traces have been found in food cut on stainless steal boards.

Is it made from glass? - Potentially toxic and hard on your knives. You will also be putting in more work as glass has no give when chopping. Some glass boards may come from China and their regulations are a bit different than the US. This might be an okay choice depending n the board.

Wood is a common cutting board material, that’s natural, right? WRONG - usually.

Most wooden cutting boards are made from separate pieces of wood that are glued together and then the board is treated with a toxic sealant for longevity.

I have used these boards in the past and have had moisture get between the pieces causing warping, cracking and worst of all, mold! It is also possible your board has mold inside already without external visibility.

Most glues and adhesives will release formaldehyde into your food. Depending on levels of exposure, formaldehyde has been shown to cause cancer and in some cases increases the risk of cancers caused by other chemicals.

There are companies out there that craft cutting boards out of a single piece of wood and treat it with organic, natural oils/waxes. These are pricier but when treated with care, they will last a very long time! Wood is also naturally antibacterial!

Unfortunately the company that made my cutting board closed its doors for good right after I received it! I absolutely recommend a board made from a single piece of wood above all other options. I notice marks from my knives and this is normal. When you treat with oil and wax these markings lessen from the moisture/conditioning. It is important to keep your board maintained properly, if the board becomes dry and brittle your knives will cause real damage. Additionally, never use a serrated blade.

I have also never experienced staining. Occasionally when I cut a red onion or cabbage the board will appear purple in certain spots. After washing and treating with oil/wax these disappear.

When looking for a cutting board you should be looking for:

A solid piece of wood - sustainable
No glues or adhesives
No mineral oil - and watch out to ensure the oil they use aligns with your preferences
Caring for a solid wood cutting board.

I love my solid wood cutting board, it took me forever to find and is now irreplaceable as the company no longer exists.

Don’t worry, there are a couple of other great options available but that is info for another day.

Assuming you already have a board you love, how do you care for it? How do you ensure it lasts a long time?

1. Organic oil
2. Organic wax

Maybe once per week, or when you chop something that you do not want to transfer to something else, meat, red onion/cabbage, etc, simply wash your board with soap and water. Make sure to wipe it dry, you do not want your board to absorb the water. Let it dry for at least 30 minutes. I tend to let it fully dry out over night.

Once dry apply a generous amount of oil. Use clean hands to massage the oil into your board. Make sure to get the sides! Let this sit and absorb. You do want the oil to sink into the wood, this will keep it from drying out. The longer you can let this sit, the better. I typically let it sit for at least 1 hour. Wipe any excess oil off with an organic cotton kitchen cloth. It is a good idea to have a couple that are only for this purpose as the oil will stain. Last step, the wax! This seals in all that oily goodness. It will keep the oil from escaping and keep water and moisture from the items you are chopping from seeping in. Massage the wax into your board with clean hands. Let the wax sit for at least 30 minutes and wipe off any excess with that same kitchen cloth.

Make sure the oils you use are organic and free of mineral oils. Absolutely no mystery oil or something that does not specify exactly what is in there. Wax must also be organic.

Never use a serrated blade on your board, this will tear it up. Non-serrated knives will absolutely leave marks, that is normal. As the moisture leaves your board these will become more apparent. That is a good signal it is time to treat your board to some TLC
