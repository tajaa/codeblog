<h2> Organic Protein Powder </h2>

Here at Laguna Coves, we keep an active lifestyle. Whether its hitting the gym to build muscle or running dogs along the California coast. We sweat. The single biggest overlooked element in peoples work outs is not the work out itself but rather what they put in their body. Garbage in, garbage out.

In order to build muscle for size or to lose weight, we need to consume a lot of protein. It's difficult to eat this as part of our daily meals--but that should always be the first option. Work organic protein into your breakfast, lunch and dinner if you can. Protein is the building block of muscles, the fuel for recovery, and the key to unlocking your body's full potential. But not all protein is created equal.

In recent years, there's been a growing interest in organic protein and its potential benefits over non-organic protein. Why is organic protein so much more important? Let's dive in.

First of all, lets get one thing straight: There is no substitute for organic animal protein--that will always be the best option, but this can be expensive and impractical for all of our protein needs. When it comes to protein in a powder form, At Laguna Coves, we always opt for organic, low sugar protein that is plant-based. It's important to try and stay away from whey. This is why:

<h3> Whey Powder?</h3>

Whey protein is not a sugar source, but instead, it is composed of amino acids that are rapidly absorbed by the body. While many are aware that refined foods such as white-bread can spike insulin, few are acquainted with the fact that whey protein can spike insulin much more. Whey protein can spike insulin one-hundred and thirty-nine percent!

However, its not all bad news. Despite raising insulin levels, it does not spike blood sugar levels. In fact, certain studies suggest that consuming whey protein post-meal can help lower blood sugar levels. However, people should remember that any consumption that raises insulin levels can simultaneously push blood sugar levels down.

Does whey powder make us gain weight though? Not really. However, it does increase insulin, which surprisingly, can have beneficial effects, particularly for those with insulin resistance. The increased insulin levels can actually help overcome the resistance, which is essentially a deficiency of insulin.

The effect of whey protein powder on insulin resistance is not completely clear. Frequently, individuals who consume whey protein powder also engage in regular exercise, which improves insulin resistance. There's no denying that whey protein stimulates muscle growth, but it also stimulates other organs and can affect the body hormonally. In fact, some data suggest that whey protein can protect the liver, while others indicate potential harm, especially if consumed without concurrent exercise.

Here at Laguna Coves, we do not use whey protein very much as we focus almost entirely on organic, non-refined products. Whey is a byproduct of the natural milk complex, and it doesn't have casein and other nutrients.

Ultimately, its hard to complete with the nutritional value of whole foods like meat, fish, or eggs may be a better choice for many as they contain high-quality amino acids and other nutrients, and cause less of an insulin spike.

So what alternatives are there?

## Enter Plant-Based Organic:

What are the benefits of Organic Protein Powder over non-organic?

Organic protein powder has become increasingly popular due to a number of potential benefits, mainly derived from the quality of its source material and the absence of certain harmful additives. Here are some key benefits of using organic protein powder:

**Free from Harmful Chemicals**: Organic protein powders are sourced from plants or animals that are not exposed to synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers, making them free from such potentially harmful chemicals.

**No Antibiotics or Hormones**: When choosing an organic animal-based protein powder (like whey or casein), you avoid the antibiotics or growth hormones that may be used in conventional animal farming.

**Non-GMO**: Organic protein powders are also Non-GMO, meaning they are free from genetically modified organisms which some people choose to avoid due to potential health concerns. 4.

**Nutrient-Dense**: Organic protein powders may be more nutrient-dense. The animals or plants they're derived from are often raised or grown in a more natural environment, which can lead to a higher nutrient content.

**Eco-Friendly**: Choosing organic products also has environmental benefits. Organic farming practices are generally more sustainable and less harmful to the environment as they promote biodiversity, reduce pollution, and avoid synthetic chemical usage.

**Better Digestibility**: Some people find organic protein powders easier to digest, particularly plant-based versions, due to the absence of certain additives and the presence of other natural, fiber-rich components. 7.

**No Artificial Additives**: Organic protein powders typically do not contain artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners. This can be a significant benefit for those wanting to avoid such additives due to health concerns or personal preferences.

<h2> Our Recommendation </h2>

For awhile we were using **Four Sigmatic** protein powder. Four Sigmatic is Organic and delicious. It was _by far_ the best tasting protein powder we have tried. However, it now has the prop 65 warning on it. While this could relate to many different reasons, this does not meet our criteria for a clean, organic protein as of now. We will try and do some research to find out where this Prop 65 warning is coming from.

Right now we am using **Kos Organic Protein** in the flavor vanilla. This is great because it is low sugar and tastes delicious. It does have Stevia which I do not personally notice but I have heard others were able to taste it. For Kos I can just throw it in a blender bottle with either milk or water and I love the taste either way.

Another option is **SunWarrior** organic protein. This is a really clean, keto approved protein. However, I cannot stand the taste! This is good in protein shakes, if you are blending it up with other ingredients, fruits, peanut butter, etc. I cannot recommend it in a blender bottle with water or milk for me the taste is not tolerable.

When choosing a protein you want to look out for the California Prop 65 Warning because even certified organic protein may have high levels of heavy metals. It should be noted that not all Prop 65 warnings are created equal--sometimes these are posted far too liberally, removing the actual benefit from the label in warnings.

Protein is crucial to a healthy lifestyle and if you workout it is a must! Donâ€™t skip it!
